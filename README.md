# Two separate data models. Data model one is unsupervised learning and clustering of anime. Data model two is the application of the pearson coefficent. 
The first model clusters the anime and tries to compare the clusters. 
The second model compares and two selected anime titles and provides a score from -1 to 1. -1 meaning the two are unrelated, 1 meaning the two are related.
I used data that was web scrapped from MAL.
